#AutoCAD P&ID vs EA

*Offers all components from ISO 15926
*Broad range of components
*Super slow and resource hungry
*No limitations (AutoCAD lets me put valves on valves on valves etc.)
*Overwhelming
*Every element must be uniquely tagged (is this a standard requirement?)
*Validates model based on ISO 15926
*Elements cannot have any attributes
*3D visualization of flows
